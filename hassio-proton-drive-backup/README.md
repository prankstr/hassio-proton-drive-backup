# Home Assistant Proton Drive Backup

Home Assistant Proton Drive Backup allows for the automated scheduling and synchronization of Home Assistant backups to Proton Drive. This addon emerged from my personal need for a Proton Drive-based backup solution and is heavily inspired by [Home Assistant Google Drive Backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup).

If you're just looking for an easy backup solution for Home Assistant and don't mind using Google Drive you probably want to use [Home Assistant Google Drive Backup](https://github.com/sabeechenhassio-google-drive-backup) in favor of this. As of now, this addon doesn't match the featureset and reliability of the Google Drive counterpart.

But if Proton Drive is your platform of choice, this addon offers a solution for that purpose!
